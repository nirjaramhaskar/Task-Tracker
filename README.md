Task Tracker App
This project is a Task Tracker App built with React. It helps users manage their tasks efficiently, allowing them to add, view, and delete tasks. The app was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed. This is a powerful feature, but use it cautiously.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks with a title and description.
View Tasks: View a list of all your tasks with their details.
Delete Tasks: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from the list.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even when the page is reloaded.
Usage
This app is useful for people who need to keep track of tasks and manage their time effectively. It's a simple yet powerful tool for organizing daily activities and ensuring nothing is missed.
